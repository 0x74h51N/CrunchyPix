      "techDescription": "In crafting CrunchyPix, we harnessed cutting-edge technologies, utilizing Next.js (14) and TypeScript as our primary tools. React, the foundational library, provided the flexibility and robustness required to bring our collective vision to life. To ensure a seamless user experience worldwide, i18n integration and custom language translation components were employed. We delved into state management, with Redux orchestrating intricate details such as language preferences, custom cursor interactions, and device responsiveness. Enchanting animation transitions, crafted with motion.div and meticulously developed custom variants, bring life to CrunchyPix. Every page, whether showcasing products or policies, is dynamically generated, offering a responsive environment. Our commitment extends to version control and collaboration tools like GitHub, where we store and manage project files. Dependabot, CodeQL, and Vercel are additional tools enhancing our development workflow.",
